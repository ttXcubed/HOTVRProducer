## Running CRAB 
The crab submission files are in `crab_mini_to_nano`. The submission files fetch the input files given in `crab_mini_to_nano/input_files.yaml`.
To run the submission:

```
python crab_mini_to_nano/crab_submission.py --year YEAR
```
where YEAR has to be specified. 
For signal samples, use crab_submission_sgn.py. 

N.B.: to test the submission is helpful to specify the option `configTmpl.Data.totalUnits = 1` in the configuration file.
